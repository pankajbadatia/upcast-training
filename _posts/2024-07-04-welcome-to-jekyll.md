Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. The rest of the file can be written in markdown and will be transformed into a beautiful and consistent blog post.

**Check out the Jekyll documentation** for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all the issues in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues).
